## Usage
From our homepage, you will see a couple of previously uploaded Task Experts. From the navigation menu, you can select if you would like to sign in, sign up, add a task, or sign out. If you already have an account, you can sign in and it will take you to the user dashboard page. From there you can edit your previously created tasks. If you do not already have an account, you just need to sign up first! You can also add a new task from the navigation bar. 

Scroll through cards to see Tasks Experts that can help with your jobs!
